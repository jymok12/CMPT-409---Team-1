-Real dataset: 
Idea - Riot data dragon (e.g. best rank for winning games as x character in y region)

grover's alg, surround with real search program (pull data as json from some real source), have search() function
Test 1: override as classical algo (actually implemented)
Test 2: override as quantum algo (call in qiskit --actually implement this)

1. time complexity analysis of program with clasical algo
2. time complexity analysis of program with quantum algo
  compare and contrast program with classical search vs quantum grover's search

Hi Professor,

Our group (Team 1) would like to do a project on: Grover's algorithm

We would like to (tentatively) use the data from Riot Games' Data Dragon dataset, and perform a search over this data to find the best in-game rank to be in, to maximize the number of won games as a certain character. We will accomplish this by using Grover's search algorithm as well as an optimal classical search algorithm, and perform a time complexity analysis on this program (with and without the quantum search), as well as compare and contrast the results.

Let me know if this works, Thanks.
